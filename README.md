# SC_TP

A simulated enviromnent (made with C programming language) where there are multiple types of clients (priority and non priority) advance trough a series of queues.
This clients are randomly generated and so are their intents of which queue to go to next.
The enviromnent is simulated during a certain period (a business day) in which client incidence varies over time (clients are more likely to appear during certain periods)

The simulator besides keeping track of all of the above generates statistics that can be avaliated to pin-point the queues that cause slow-downs in the system.
